# Demo data and analysis notebooks

This directory contains the example dataset and Jupyter notebooks used to generate the analyses and figures presented in the manuscript:

> *ManuTrace: An HTML-based interface for manually extracting movement trajectory data from a video*  
> (Ecology and Evolution, in review)

The materials provided here allow users to:
- Inspect the raw videos and extracted trajectories used in the paper
- Reproduce the statistical analyses
- Recreate the figures shown in the Results section

## Dataset archive

### `extracted_trajectories.zip`

This zip archive contains all raw and derived data used in the manuscript, including:
- Spatial scale calibration data
- Trajectories extracted using:
  - ManuTrace (manual tracking)
  - UMA Tracker
  - idTracker.ai
  - TRex
### `videos_natural.zip`
- Raw video recordings of termite groups in natural condition
### `videos_optimized.zip`
- Raw video recordings of termite groups in tracker-optimized condition

### Summary of contents

- **Extracted trajectories**
  - CSV files containing two-dimensional image-plane coordinates
  - Organized by recording condition and tracking software
  - Manual trajectories include explicit labels distinguishing manually recorded and interpolated coordinates

- **Videos**
  - Recorded under two conditions:
    - `natural`: routine laboratory recording conditions
    - `optimized`: background and lighting optimized for automated tracking
  - Each video contains 12 individuals recorded for 1 minute (1,800 frames)

These data correspond directly to Figures 3 and 4 in the manuscript.

## Analysis and figure reproduction

### `demo_analysis.ipynb`

This notebook contains **all analyses and figure generation steps used in the manuscript**.

Specifically, it performs the following tasks:

1. **Data loading**
   - Loads trajectory CSV files generated by ManuTrace and automated tracking tools
   - Reads spatial scale calibration data to convert pixel coordinates to physical distances

2. **Trajectory visualization**
   - Plots movement trajectories extracted by different tracking tools for the same video
   - Generates comparative trajectory visualizations used in **Figure 3**

3. **Quantification of locomotor activity**
   - Computes total distance traveled per individual from ManuTrace trajectories
   - Aggregates data across individuals, videos, species, and recording conditions

4. **Statistical analysis**
   - Fits linear mixed-effects models with:
     - Fixed effects: species, recording condition
     - Random effect: video identity
   - Performs likelihood ratio tests corresponding to the statistical results reported in the manuscript

5. **Figure generation**
   - Produces all plots shown in the Results section, including:
     - Comparative trajectory plots (**Figure 3**)
     - Distributions of locomotor activity (**Figure 4**)

All results and figures reported in the manuscript can be reproduced by executing this notebook from top to bottom.

## Notes on scope
This notebook is intended as a demonstration and reproduction example, not as a general-purpose analysis pipeline.
For new datasets, users may need to modify file paths, scale calibration parameters, or model specifications.
